README for zping
================

I wrote zping to combine features from both the common ping and fping
programs. In particular, I wanted the -f flag in ping (to enable flood
ping, sending packets out as fast as they return) and fping's ability to
ping a long list of hosts.


COMPILE AND INSTALL
-------------------

Usual GNU style.

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install
